# ProjectX

_Project environment extensions for the Julia language._

ProjectX allows you store various additional settings in your project's `Project.toml` file. If you have `using ProjectX` in your global `startup.jl` file, it will look at the `Project.toml` of your active project and applies them during the Julia startup phase.

## Installation & usage

The package is currently unregistered. To install, you need to add it via the URL in the Pkg REPL mode:

```
pkg> add https://github.com/mortenpi/ProjectX.jl.git
```

To use the package, put `using ProjectX` in your startup file (e.g. in `~/.julia/config/startup.jl`). The settings from the project environment get applied during the `using` call, so you most likely want it to be the last item in your startup file â€” this way project-specific settings get applied after your global settings.

Under the hood, ProjectX looks for the active project, reads the `Project.toml` file and applies any known settings it finds. All this happens in ProjectX's `__init__` call, so the first time the package is loaded.

## Supported settings

### Environment variables

Using the `environment` table you can set environment variables in `ENV`. I.e. if you have the following in the `Project.toml`

```
[environment]
FOO="bar"
```

It will set the corresponding environment variable

```julia-repl
julia> ENV["FOO"]
"bar"
```

### `LOAD_PATH`

Can be set by specifying `juliaenv.load_path` in the `Project.toml`. It is interpreted as if it was passed via the `JULIA_LOAD_PATH` environment variable.

For example, to add the `lib/` subdirectory to the `LOAD_PATH`, you can set the `Project.toml` up as follows:

```toml
[juliaenv]
load_path = "lib/:@:@v#.#:@stdlib"
```

ProjectX will then set `LOAD_PATH` variable to

```julia-repl
julia> LOAD_PATH
4-element Array{String,1}:
 "/path/to/project/lib/"
 "@"
 "@v#.#"
 "@stdlib"
```

### Startup script

A `juliaenv.startup` string will be interpreted as a startup script, similar to a `startup.jl` file, e.g.:

```toml
[juliaenv]
startup = """
using Revise
my_convenience_function(x) = x + 1
"""
```

ProjectX evaluates the startup script in the `Main` module.

## Known limitations

* When changing active environments with `pkg> activate` or `Pkg.activate()`, the environment is not reloaded from the new project environment.
